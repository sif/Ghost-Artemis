# Contributing to Ghost Artemis

Thank you for considering contributing to Ghost Artemis! We value the diverse perspectives and expertise that contributors from different backgrounds bring to the project. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, your contributions are essential in helping this platform grow and evolve.
## Getting Started

1. **Familiarize Yourself**: Begin by exploring the current codebase, understanding the architecture, and going through open issues to identify where you might be able to help.
   
2. **Communication**: Before diving into coding, communicate your intention to work on a particular issue or feature. This ensures that efforts are not duplicated and provides an opportunity for the community to give input or feedback. You can start by checking on the [issues](https://github.com/sif/Ghost-Artemis/issues) or by reaching out directly.

3. **Development Environment**: We encourage the use of Python for development. Ensure you have the necessary tools and setups, such as a suitable IDE or text editor, and familiarize yourself with the project's coding standards.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Branching**: Always create a new branch for your work. This keeps the master branch clean and makes it easier to review and merge contributions.
  
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that indicate the changes you've made and their purpose.

- **Testing**: Make sure to test your code thoroughly. Any new features or significant changes should come with corresponding tests.

- **Documentation**: If your changes require updates to the documentation or if you're introducing a new feature, ensure that it's well-documented.

- **Continuous Integration**: We plan to use GitHub Actions for our CI/CD. Familiarize yourself with it to ensure your contributions align with the CI/CD processes.

## Submitting Your Changes

Once you're ready to submit your changes:

1. Push your branch to the repository.
2. Create a new Pull Request (PR) against the `master` branch.
3. In the PR description, explain the changes you made, the reasons behind them, and any other relevant information.
4. Wait for a review. Address any feedback or changes requested by the maintainers.
