# Contributing to Ghost Artemis

Hi! Ghost Artemis is meant to be a platform for people of all backgrounds to get their hands dirty on technology development. Grow with me as I go through this.

Start by checking on the issues or by reaching out to me. I highly encourage using Python to develop as I plan to use GitHub Action for our CI/CD.
